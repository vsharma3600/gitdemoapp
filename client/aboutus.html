  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <t1>We are seven men who have created the future of the lottery</t1>
  <br>
  <t1>We are a group of highschoolers attending the Brandeis app design summer precollege program. Our goal is to creat a way for users to be able to gamble without using real money but be able to gain money through the use of ad's. Since this is a
    new program we are looking for people who want to post ad's if you want to post an add on this site and help get us started, please contact us at our email/phone addresses located in the contactus page. If the link to the page doesn't work add
